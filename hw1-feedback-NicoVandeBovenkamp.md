**Overall:** Good work! Your answers are on point!

**Some notes**

* ***Part 2 - Q.1:*** Table looks good! However, the rank or prestige of the school is actually a discrete, ordinal or categorical measure. The data can only take values in the set: {1, 2, 3, 4}.
* ***Part 3 - Q.1:*** All very good points, and very accurately describes the goal of exploratory analysis. One important point, though, is to discover, and then handle, missing values. Missing values come up in data all the time, and they must be handled with care.

**Suggestion:** Always keep statistical tests in mind when you just start working with a data set. It dips a bit into modeling/feature engineering at times, but tests (to test for distributions, for difference of means, etc.) are very handy!
